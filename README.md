# Comparative-Analysis-of-Machine-Learning-Models

Project Steps:

1. Introduction:
   
 Brief overview of the MHEALTH dataset.
 Importance of activity recognition in healthcare and wellness monitoring.
 Objective of the project: To compare the performance of K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural
Network, and Logistic Regression for activity recognition.

2. Dataset Exploration:
   
 Download the dataset from
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gaurav2022/mobile-health/data).
 Visualization of sample data points.
Note: Due to the large size of the training data, students may opt to use a subset
of the training data for model training to reduce computational complexity and
training time. However, it's important to ensure that the subset is representative
of the overall dataset.

3. Model Training:
   
 Training each of the selected models on the training dataset.
 Hyperparameter tuning if necessary for KNN, SVM, Neural Network, and
Logistic Regression.
 Cross-validation to ensure model generalization.

4. Model Evaluation:

 Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix
(for KNN, SVM, Neural Network, and Logistic Regression).
 Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for Linear Regression.
 Comparison of performance between different models.

5. Results Analysis:
   
 Interpretation of model predictions.
 Identification of the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
 Discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of each model.
 Insights into the factors contributing to the performance variation across
different models.

6. Conclusion:
   
 Recap of key findings and conclusions drawn from the comparative
analysis.
 Summary of the best model for activity recognition based on the MHEALTH
dataset.
